" .. it will be better if you keep your seat belts fastend during the travel.."

Immediately after the announcement, passenger sitting on seat 59A ran towards the washroom.
the Airhostedd gave a sigh of relief when the man headed towards to washroom.

"Sheela, did you think that the man is hijacker?" Jamshed asked laughing but in a low voice.
"We can't say anything in today's world. Take a look at 60A. He looks suspicious"
Jamshed took a look without moving his head. "Should I tell you something Sheel? You are too nervous now a days. You will even doubt the pilots some day! He looks suspicous because he is drunk"

60A was a heavy built european traveller. After the announcement was translated in English he also headed towards the washroom.
Half sleeved unbuttoned shirt and denmin trouser. Any other time people would have noticed his well built physique but at the moment they could only see the effect of alcohol.

Till now "King Vikramaditya" was cruising at an altitude of 30000 feets. Cabin was calm and Water in a glass would not have moved but 60A was not able to walk properly and was losing his balance as he was drunk. With much effort he reached washroom. He tried opening but it remained closd.

"Sir, this washroom is in use. If you need it urgently you can use one of the washrooms downstairs " Jamshed said in soft words.

"Thank you, I will wait here"

Looking at the narrow spiralling staircase going downwards from executive class Jamshed thought 60A's decision was right.
Jamshed felt like giving his seat to 60A. But just then washroom door opened. 59A cames out giving a look of dislike to the fair and heavy built european and sent back to his seat. 60A went to the bathroom.

"Let's go. Time for serviing the snacks" Jamshed advised Shila.

Wehn 60A came out, Jamshed and Shila were busy in arranging the snack tray. So they could not notice the swollen left pocket of 60A's trouser.Due to mess created by 60A they did not notice one more thing. The pouch which 59A carried withi him while going to washroom was not with him when he came out..

The Boeing jet heading towards London landed in New Delhi as per schedule. Seat 59A which was occupied during Mumbai-New Delhi journey was now vacant.
60A was sleeping quitely. There were innocent emotions on his face.
