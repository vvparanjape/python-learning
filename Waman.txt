" .. it will be better if you keep your seat belts fastend during the travel.."

Immediately after the announcement, passenger sitting on seat 59A ran towards the washroom.
the Airhostedd gave a sigh of relief when the man headed towards to washroom.

"Sheela, did you think that the man is hijacker?" Jamshed asked laughing but in a low voice.
"We can't say anything in today's world. Take a look at 60A. He looks suspicious"
Jamshed took a look without moving his head. "Should I tell you something Sheel? You are too nervous now a days. You will even doubt the pilots some day! He looks suspicous because he is drunk"

60A was a heavy built european traveller. After the announcement was translated in English he also headed towards the washroom.
Half sleeved unbuttoned shirt and denmin trouser. Any other time people would have noticed his well built physique but at the moment they could only see the effect of alcohol.

Till now "King Vikramaditya" was cruising at an altitude of 30000 feets. Cabin was calm and Water in a glass would not have moved but 60A was not able to walk properly and was losing his balance as he was drunk. With much effort he reached washroom. He tried opening but it remained closd.

"Sir, this washroom is in use. If you need it urgently you can use one of the washrooms downstairs " Jamshed said in soft words.

"Thank you, I will wait here"

Looking at the narrow spiralling staircase going downwards from executive class Jamshed thought 60A's decision was right.
Jamshed felt like giving his seat to 60A. But just then washroom door opened. 59A cames out giving a look of dislike to the fair and heavy built european and sent back to his seat. 60A went to the bathroom.

"Let's go. Time for serviing the snacks" Jamshed advised Shila.

Wehn 60A came out, Jamshed and Shila were busy in arranging the snack tray. So they could not notice the swollen left pocket of 60A's trouser.Due to mess created by 60A they did not notice one more thing. The pouch which 59A carried withi him while going to washroom was not with him when he came out..

The Boeing jet heading towards London landed in New Delhi as per schedule. Seat 59A which was occupied during Mumbai-New Delhi journey was now vacant.
60A was sleeping quitely. There were innocent emotions on his face.

Because of phone ring Arul came out of his trans. For past hanf an hour he was sitting in front of his terminal solving his problems. There was must have been some issue in the program he wrote because computer was not accpeting his programs and throwing "Error" and "Invalid" message making him angry.
In Arul's view computer is an idiot and only does what it is told to do.
He always used to debate with his friends on how much importance people give to a computer. He accepted that computer can do millions of calculations in a second, information saved in its memory or storage can be can be searched and retrieved in a fraction of a second. Many difficult challenges faced by scientists could not have been solved without a computer. Arul hinself was defeated in chess by computer number of times. But what does this prove - according to Arul - computer is a quick and efficient slave. It can only execute the given instructions as per the program fed into it earlier.
It can'do do anything beyond its limited logic was Arul's defence in favour of his argument.
Now take today's instance - the problem was not getting sovled due to a manor mistake because of which Arul was wasting so much time. It must be a minor issue but computer was not able to understand.
And now this phone...
While picking up the received Arul was a bit curious because the time was 7:00 AM. At thsi hour there was pin drop silence in the institute. The telephone operator himself doesn't wake up until 8 am. So this call must be an internal call within institute.
His guess was right. 
"Arul Air, Duty officer Shirke speaking, there is a trunk call for you from Bangalore" Sound came from other side of telephone line.
"Ok, hold it I will be right there".

While elevator was coming down Arul was wondering if this call was from his Father or about his father. His father was 70 plus staying alone at Bangalore. His health condition was bit unpredictable. but he was not ready to leave his house with a garden and come to stay with Arul in his flat on 8th floor.
There were 2 landlines at reception. From 8 pm to 8 am there was no telephone operator in the office. One of the landline receiver was kept aside and Shirke called Arul from other. Arul picked up the receiver.
"Hello...Hello.. This is Arul speaking"
Arul heard the operator's voice from the speaker " Demand call for you Sir, Hello Bangalore, go ahead please?
And operator's clear voice was placed by a very low pitched voice. Arul asked him to speak louder.

"Dr. Arul, Raghavan here". Arul gave a sigh of relief knowing the call was not about his father's health.
Raghavan was project manager at Gauribidnur. This was a huge project on the theory of gravity. Project was at a preliminary stage. Raghavan had called him before as well to discuss about problems in construction but not this early in the day. Later words explained the reason " ..called you because an unexpected thing has happened"
Raghavan was talking and Arul was listening - Shirke was watching his face which cold not hid a surprized look.

"Is Mr. Jagdale there?"
"Sir, may I know your name?"
Arul told his name and address. This was not the first time he was Calling Mantralaya. He used to wonder about this question - as if anser of it depended on who is calling.
But he had very well understood that there is huge difference in logic used in Maths and science and logic used in Matralaya.
so he never used to go to Mantralaya except for some unavoidable reasons.
Today there was that unavoidable reason.

Because of the trunk call in the morning he had to go to Gauribidnur. He had missed the morning flite but he could still take the evening flite. The travel coordinator of the institute went to Indian Airlines office but could not get a seat reserved for evening flite. He got the ticket but seat reservation was in waiting list.
All reserved seats were sold out.  Of course this meant all seats for general public are sold out but seats for public servents - the government quota - were yet available as per his inside information.Ths was the time when his classmate Sachin Jagdale who was working in revenue department was going to be useful.


"Sir is not in office now, he has gone for a meeting" 
This was one of the five reasons he usually used to get.
"When will he be back in office?" He knew the question is useless but still he asked.
"We dont know that but he is going on a tour to Yawatmal at 3 PM"

This was definitely important informatio. Out of two negative options finding Jagdale was better option.
Arul gave his phone number but he knew from his experiences except for execptional circumstances do not answer the letters or do not call back was motto of India administrative services.

So he called repititively at 12, 12:15, 12:30 and was able to speak to Mr. Jagdale.
By makimg some adjustments he gave Arul a VIP seat.
Though Mr. Jagdale was a beuraucrat he was a science graduate and had respect for science. He was also aware of the respect Arul had among the well know scientists.

Even after doing all this taking the tickets from office and get the seat number printed on them was donw 3:30 pm.
After reaching home Arul packed his bags, took some important papers and went to airport.
"Please arrive at airport one hour fifteen minutes prior to departure" was the instruction from airline is only for passengers.Because while entering the terminal at 4:45PM PA system was annoucing " Indian Airlines regret to inform Flite IC100 to Bangalore will be delayed by two hours tirty minutes" 

Experience make man wiser. once upon a time when Arul had complained for the bad service escalating to even the general manager. But unless there is a competition and number of seats are way too less than the travellers this will not change. Word 'regret' in the announcement was only for formality.
And two hours thirty minutes in the announcement meant minimum time for the delay.
Arul always factored this kind of delay in his plans and used to take work related documents with him.
When other passengers had gathered to form a crowd looking for the staff member missing from his desk Arul was work on the papers in a corner chair.

2hours 3 minutes stretched to 4 hours and when Arul's flite landed at Bangalore it was 11:30 PM.

Raghawan was waiting with a Jeep. When the jeep left the Airport premises and turned towards the eastern highway Arul could not hold back his curiosity any further/
"Raghavan, now tell me in detail about your treasure. Tell me from start as I was not able to hear you clearly on telephone." 

Raghavan cleared his throat and started.
"Arul, I called you early in the morning because because there was an unexpected interruption in our escavation last night....you know our project is running behind the schedule and hence digging is going on for twenty hours a day...Last night when we reached at 98 meters and were ready to complete the remaining 4 meters. But after reaching 100m depth we came across a layer of metal. It was so hard that drilling machine was ineffective on it."

Arul whistled softly but didn't speak anything. Raghavan continued,  "This Metal layer was square shaped approximately 3 by 3 meters. Luckily the well which we are digging is large enough so we could dig further leaving the metal surface untouched at the center. Hence I took a decision to go ahead"

"you did the right thing!" Arul said. Raghavan used to get things done with sheer will and no-nonsense approach. Hence he had selected Raghavan as project manager.

"Afterdigging from sides we realized the metal is not natural but an alloy and it was a cubical shaped box."

"Cubical?" Arul wanted to make sure. He had heard the same word over the phone call in the morning.

"Yes right. Cubical All its sides are of same length - approximately 3 meters. Maybe a Mumbai home will fit in it."

"You keep taunting Mumbai but situation at Bangalore is going to be the same Raghavan. Anyways, Did you open the box? you have a crane available to take it out of the well."

Raghavan was quite. He was uable to answer. At last he said "Situation is a bit wierd Arul."

"Wierd? Why?" Arul was surprised.
"The lid is not visible distinctly and there are wierd shapes and letters carved on it."
""In which language are these letters?
"I couldn't identify the langiage. I have read many books in our library, I also asked many other colleagues in Bangalore but no one could identify it." Raghavan said, "An altogether new challenge has surfaced."
"What is that?" Arul felt Gaghavan has come to the main point.
"A technician had seen an english movie in the past and he recalled a scene similar to our situation.
In that move during similar excavation in Egypt they find a box and when they open it an alive mummy comes out of it. He talked about this in tea break and workers are not ready to even look at the box now."

"What  nonsense" Arul was angry.
"I also could have said the same Arul, but..."
"But what?"
"the images on the box..." Raghavan stammered, "everyone find them terrifying."

Immediately after the traffic signal turned geen the car at the first row turned right and speedily disappeard - Cars on opposite side were spellbound by the speed and firing of the car.


"What a car man! and I drive this bullok cart..." a taxi driver exclaime while trying to push the accelerator on his old ambassador.
"It must be owned by a foreigner" said the passenger in the taxi.
"The car is foreign made but the owner is India. Whole Delhi knows this car - he is driving this car for last 5 months on Delhi roads" replied the Punjabi taxi driver cuddling his beard.

The Alfa Romeo card which turned from Aurobindo road to ring road quickly turned towards Vasant vihar colony.
Its owner obviously was proud of his car. From his childhood Navinchandra Pande loved fast cars.
This attaraction converted into ambition as he grew.
Some people think Rolls Royce is best, some like Cadillac and some want to own Mercedez-Benz.
Navin didn't like the luxury cars. In europe he had seen many cars and selected Alpha Romeo and brought it to India paying hefty duties.
When the bright red car arrived in Delhi, it become a gossip subject immediately across Delhi.
Crosing 2 lanes Navin smoothly drove the car through the narrow gate of bungalow and pressed the break pedal.Car stopped with loud noise from breaks. Navin took out a device from glove compartment and pressed left side button on it. The garage shutter rolled up quickly and Navin swiftly parked his red beauty in the garage.

Equipped with latest gadgets, a bungalow in Vasant Vihar, imported car, overseas trips - from all this anyone would imagine that Navin must be a successful industrialist or a famous actor. But fact was different.

Contrary to the meaning of his name Navin was interested in old things. He was an expert officer in archiology department. He had made significant contributions to the archeological archives in India.

He always stressed on use of latest technology even if his area of interest was in archeology that dealt in age old items.
He had learnt new techniques required for arheology and he was world renowned as best expert in Indian archeology.
But then what was the secret of opulance in his life? If he had been married we could point it towards his rich father-in-law. Although there were so many ladies around him he did not get married.
He had shown his wealth as inheritence to income tax department and had made arrangements to make sure they will not probe much into it.


"Hey Ramsekvak, any important news?" Navin asked while sinking into his favourite chair.
As usual Ramsevak brought in a tray with Navin's favourite Scotch on the rocks on it.

"Sir, Runadevi had called. She has invited you for dinner tonight. Hence I have not cooked anything for dinner tonight. And someone's servent has given letter for you." Ramsevak pointed to the letter in the tray. 
Ramsevak knew nowadays Runa is closer to his master. He did not miss a smile flashed on Navin's face on hearing her name.

"Ok Ramsevak, take a holiday today, watch a film"
Navin knew Ramsevak was a bollywood fan and loved to watch any and every bollywood movie.

"Ok Sir" After Runa's call Ramsevak had already called his friend and had arranged tickets, but didn't feel like telling this to Navin.

After Ramsevak went out Navin picked up the envelope on the tray. There was no sender's name on it but by looking at the monogram on it Navin's mood changed and his face fainted.
Unwillingly he opened the envelope and glanced at the letter inside. It had only 2 lines.

It has been months that we didn't meet.
Can you meet me at Shesh mahal at 8 pm?


There was no signature or sender's name but Navin didn't need it. He knew who that was.

Giving out a sigh he picked up the phone receiver and dialed a number.
"Runa darling...Navin here. Yes, I got the message..but not possible today...I can't do anything....Runa, dont misunderstand me...Runa...Runa..."

There was no point in speaking on a disconnected line. Navin looked at his watch. It was 7:30. He kept the scotch glass down and stood up.

It was exactly 8 pm when he parked his Alpha Romeo in Hotel Akbar's parking and then entered through the newly decorated main door.

There was hardly any crowd in the hotel. So when he glanced inside the restaurent he found the expected man quite easily.

"Welcome Navin bro! no one can beat you in punctuality...so whats the plan today? Drink dinner and discussion?" asked the man in a blue safari suit.

"Let's eat, talk and then drink" Navin replied. He had experienced in past after talking to Pyarelal he often lost the appetite.

Both were too hungry so Navin ordered the dinner. Pyarelal gave a jealous look at Navin as he somehow was eating so called 'healthy' food allowed in his diet plan.

Post dinner to move agenda forward Navin asked "How's your electronics business going?"
"Well.." Pyarelal said "going on as usual"
Just then waiter came with coffee tray. When he was gone there was silence for few moment.
Then Pyarelal said "How about yours. I ask everyone I meet whats new on their side but for you I need to ask opposite - what old things you found recently."
"Nothing Special", Navin said.
"But I need it, There is too much demand. you will get lot of commission. Dont you need AC for your red toy?"

Secret of Pyarelal's success was he knew about Navin's interests very well.

"Nowadays government is keeping strict watch. I have a doubt that somoene is watching me. I doubt after the Vikramaditya incident someone is keeping a watch on me. I felt it when I landed the Delhi internation Airport."

"Nonsense" Pyarelal responded, "you are getting suspicious for no reasone/ There are many customers with lot of money. If I dont provide them with goods they will hire another broker. I read many things were found in the excavation in Madhya Pradesh. If the catalogging is not completed, then...."
"I will try. But I think there is not much value of things from Gupta dynasty"
"You dont think about value and demand, thats my department not yours. you only take care of the supply... see This.." Pyarelal showed a paper.
Their discussion continued for half an hour.
"OK Then, talk is over so shold we order some drinks?"
"No! I have to drive.." Navin said goodbye and walked out of the restaurent.
Pyarelal was surprised. Navin had never avoided drinks. First time a doubt came in his mind on how long Navin would be useful for his "side-business"
